# Sort algorithm comparison
This repo will show you how fast can a sort algorithm runs.
## Sort algorithm list
- Bubble sort
- Heap sort
- Insertion sort
- Merge sort
- Quick sort
- Selection sort
- Shaker sort
- Shell sort

These algorithms are writed in C++ (source above).
The test data set is divided into 4 categories: random, ascending, descending and nearly-incremental.
Program to generate test dataset written in Pascal (code above).
